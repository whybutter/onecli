/**
 * The current organization (`GET /v1/org`) — today, the create door's source
 * for the org's creation world (`byoLegacy`). An org's world changes only by
 * a manual operator action, hence the infinite stale time.
 *
 * Cloud-only by construction (`enabled: IS_CLOUD`): the door ignores the org
 * on self-host, so the fetch would be pure waste there. NOTE that a disabled
 * query still reports `isPending: true` forever — consumers gating a render
 * on `isPending` must guard it with `IS_CLOUD`.
 *
 * Callers must treat a missing `data` as "not known yet", never as a world
 * decision — gate on `isPending` (in-flight) and let an errored read fall
 * back, so an org-read failure can't lock the page or flip anyone's door.
