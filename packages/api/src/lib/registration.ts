 * The pre-2.0 upgrade window — the one moment registration refuses anyone.
 *
 * A deployment upgrading from the no-login era carries a passwordless
 * placeholder row whose data (`legacy-adoption.ts`) is handed to the first
 * account that registers. That adoption requires the table to hold EXACTLY the
 * placeholder and the claimer — its safety fence against handing an
 * established instance's data to a stranger. So while an unclaimed placeholder
 * exists AND a registered account is already waiting to claim it, further
 * registrations are refused; the claimer's first sign-in completes the
 * adoption (seconds, normally), which overwrites the placeholder's identity
 * and disarms this guard for good. Without the refusal, a second registrant
 * arriving in that window would make the adoption impossible forever — the
 * operator's organization, agents and conversations would be orphaned with no
 * way back.
 *
 * Called from the identity layer's user-creation hook, which fires for the
 * password path AND for a social sign-in that would create a new user, so no
 * route around it exists.
 *
 * ## If it fires with MORE than one real account
 *
 * That signature means two claimers slipped through together (the same
 * few-milliseconds race the first-account window has always had) and the
 * adoption is now stuck: it will never see exactly-two rows again — and by
 * the time anyone reads the log, each raced claimer's first sign-in has
 * already bootstrapped them a personal organization, which adoption's
 * owns-nothing condition also refuses. The remedy is manual and the log line
 * below says so — to keep the old install's data, delete EVERY registered
 * user row and the organizations bootstrapped for them (returning the table
 * to exactly the placeholder) and register once more; to abandon the old
 * data instead, delete the unclaimed `local-admin` row.
