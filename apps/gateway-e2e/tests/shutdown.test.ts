/**
 * What the gateway does when it is asked to stop.
 *
 * Until this existed the binary had no signal handler at all — and because it
 * runs as PID 1 in its container, the kernel discarded SIGTERM outright, so
 * every deploy waited out the orchestrator's stop timeout and ended in a
 * SIGKILL that cut live requests mid-flight.
 *
 * These tests drive the real signal and assert on what an operator and an agent
 * can actually observe: the exit, its timing, and what happened to the work
 * that was in progress.
