/**
 * The instant `api_keys.last_used_at` started recording — the timestamp of the
 * migration that added the column (20260812101500_add_api_key_last_used_at).
 *
 * Unlike the agents' last-seen this is not a rolling query bound; the column
 * records continuously. It is the honesty bound on calling a null "never": a
 * key minted at or after this instant with no `lastUsedAt` provably has never
 * authenticated, while an older key's null only means it has not authenticated
 * *since the column existed*. Hard-coded on purpose — it is a fact about the
 * schema's history, not a tunable.
 *
 * TWO CAVEATS, both erring toward over-claiming "Never used":
 *
 * 1. This is when the migration was AUTHORED, not when it was APPLIED, and
 *    environments deploy on their own schedules. A key minted in the gap —
 *    after this timestamp but before the migration actually landed in that
 *    environment — reads "Never used" even if it was in daily use, because
 *    nothing was recording yet. The gap closes on the key's first
 *    authentication after the migration lands, so this is transient for any
 *    key actually in circulation; it is only misleading for a key that went
 *    dormant inside the gap.
 * 2. Nothing mechanically ties this value to the migration directory, so
 *    renaming or re-timestamping that migration silently desyncs it. If the
 *    migration moves, move this too.

 *
 * Recency is deliberately coarse. The write is throttled
 * (API_KEY_LAST_USED_THROTTLE_MS), so this lags real use by up to that window
 * — invisible at the granularity rendered ("3h ago"), and the reason
 * observing a key costs no per-request write.
