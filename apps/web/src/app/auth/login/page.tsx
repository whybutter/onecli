 * Whether this deployment is still waiting for its first account decides which
 * screen a visitor should be on: until then there is nothing to log in TO, so
 * everyone is sent to the signup form. Once an account exists, both screens
 * are offered and cross-link each other.
 *
 * Resolved on the server rather than fetched by the browser: a client-side
 * answer would render "Log in" and then swap it out, on the very first screen
 * an operator ever sees.
 *
 * A database that cannot answer resolves to "established" — the safe
 * direction. It shows the sign-in form (which will fail with its own message)
 * instead of turning a transient blip into an error page where the login used
 * to be.
