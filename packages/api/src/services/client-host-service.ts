/**
 * Resolve a `ClientHost`'s stable identity for an enrollment request: either
 * mints a brand-new one, or reuses an existing one for renewal.
 *
 * `ClientHost` is per-HOST, not per-enrollment call: this is what makes
 * `spiffeUri` a durable identity a relay can keep presenting across
 * certificate renewals (re-calling this same endpoint, short-lived certs by
 * design) rather than a new row — and identity — minted every time.
 *
 * - `hostId` omitted (first enrollment): create a fresh row, server-generated
 *   `id` + `spiffe://onecli/host/<id>`, and return it.
 * - `hostId` provided (renewal): look up that row SCOPED TO `workspaceId` —
 *   the caller's own tenant, from `AuthContext`, never trust the client's
 *   `hostId` alone — and reuse its existing `id`/`spiffeUri`. Never falls
 *   through to creating a new row on a lookup miss.
 *
 * IDOR guard: `findFirst({ where: { id: hostId, workspaceId } })` returns
 * nothing for BOTH "no such host" and "that host belongs to a different
 * workspace" — the two cases are handled identically (a `NOT_FOUND` thrown
 * here, not silently falling through to `create`), so a caller probing
 * another tenant's `hostId` cannot distinguish "wrong tenant" from "doesn't
 * exist" and never learns anything about a row it doesn't own.
 *
 * The id is generated client-side (`randomUUID()`, passed explicitly to
 * `create` instead of relying on the schema's `@default(uuid())`)
 * specifically so `spiffeUri` can be derived from it and written in the same
 * insert; deriving it from a DB-assigned id would need a second round-trip
 * update, racy on the column's `@unique` constraint if two enrollments ever
 * landed between create and update.
 *
 * `label` has no uniqueness constraint (it's a human-readable hint, not an
 * identifier) — a workspace can enroll multiple unlabeled hosts, each getting
 * its own row and its own spiffe URI.
