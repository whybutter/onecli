/**
 * Org-scope gateway usage: request volume for the rolling window, split by
 * agent.
 *
 * ## What `request_logs` actually is — read this before adding a metric
 *
 * It is NOT a record of total gateway traffic. The gateway's writer
 * (`apps/gateway/src/telemetry.rs`, `insert_batch`) persists a row only when
 * the request injected a credential OR the policy decision was anything other
 * than a plain allow:
 *
 * ```rust
 * .filter(|e| e.injected || !matches!(e.decision, RequestDecision::Allowed))
 * ```
 *
 * A pass-through on the agent's own key is never written. "Total gateway
 * requests" is therefore NOT COMPUTABLE from this table, and no caller may
 * label these numbers that way — the UI says "recorded gateway requests" and
 * explains the gap in a tooltip. `integrationCalls` (rows with
 * `injection_count > 0`) is exact, because injection is precisely the
 * condition that guarantees a row.
 *
 * Only the typed columns are read: `agent_id`, `project_id`, `injection_count`,
 * `created_at`. `extra_data` is deliberately untouched — the OSS gateway's
 * INSERT above never writes it (only `update_batch` does, for approval
 * resolutions), so anything derived from it would be null for ~every row.
 */

/**
 * Rolling lookback for the usage period. Bounded for the same reason
 * `LAST_SEEN_WINDOW_MS` is (see `lib/agent-activity.ts`): the group-by is
 * `(project_id, created_at)`-indexed, so a `createdAt >= start` predicate makes
 * it a range scan instead of a walk of every project's whole log history.
 * `request_logs` has no retention or pruning anywhere in the repo, so an
 * unbounded aggregate grows without limit by construction.

/**
 * Usage for every project the caller may reach in this org.

 * project ids the caller may see is the only way to scope the aggregate to an
 * org at all. Consequently this read is member-visible with per-project
 * fencing rather than admin-only — a member sees exactly their bound projects'
 * traffic. A caller with no reachable projects gets a ZEROED summary carrying
 * real period bounds, never a 403: "you can see nothing" is an empty result,
 * not a permission error (the `GET /projects` precedent).
 *
 * The `Ids` half of that name is a COST choice, never a scope one — it is the
 * same `visibleProjectsWhere` fence `listProjects` runs, differing only in
 * selecting nothing but the id. Ids are all this function wants; `listProjects`
 * would additionally bill every Usage load for the card grid's three grouped
 * inventory counts and then discard them. Do not "simplify" this back.

  // It is tempting to read the `$transaction` as making both aggregates see
  // one snapshot, which would make the clamp redundant. It does NOT.
  // `$transaction([...])` runs at the database's default isolation level and
  // nothing sets one (no `isolationLevel` anywhere in the repo;
  // `packages/db/src/index.ts` constructs a bare `PrismaClient`). Postgres
  // defaults to READ COMMITTED, under which every statement takes its own
  // snapshot — a row committed between the two `groupBy`s is visible to the
  // second one but not the first.
  //
  // So the inversion is genuinely reachable: a request landing mid-pair can be
  // counted by the injected query and missed by the total one, yielding
  // `integrationCalls > requests` — the self-contradicting page this design
  // exists to prevent. `Math.min` is what actually prevents it.
  //
  // The transaction is kept for connection hygiene (one connection, one
  // round-trip pair), not for isolation. Raising the isolation to
  // `RepeatableRead` would also close the window, but it buys nothing the
  // clamp doesn't already cover and costs a heavier transaction.
  //
  // The two queries are hoisted into consts rather than written inline in the
  // array: Prisma's `groupBy` return type is inferred from the argument
  // literal, and inside `$transaction([...])` that inference collapses (it
  // demands an explicit `orderBy` and widens `_count` to `true | {...}`).
  // Assigning first keeps the precise per-call type; `$transaction` then just
  // sequences the already-typed promises.
