/**
 * The Groups nav-visibility truth table on the SELF-HOST lane.
 *
 * Its own file because the rule is lane-specific: `nav-config` reads `CAPS`,
 * which `@/lib/env` freezes at module load, so the shared nav-config.test.ts
 * (running under whatever edition the CI lane sets) cannot host it. On an
 * RBAC build the entry always shows — that arm is nav-config.cloud.test.ts.
 *
 * The rule itself: hidden while the runtime entitlement is UNKNOWN (no flash
 * before `GET /v1/instance` answers), shown once it is known EITHER way — an
 * unlicensed deployment still shows the entry, which lands on the
 * server-gated license card rather than pretending the feature is absent.
