/**
 * The SHARED-app install lifecycle: one deployment-owned Slack app, installed
 * per workspace with a plain OAuth consent click. The install powers team
 * onboarding (the bot answers DMs with an account button) and — when the
 * consent granted the app-manager user scopes — minting per-agent apps
 * without a pasted config token. Per-agent dedicated apps stay the one
 * attach behavior (agent-channel-service).
 *
 * Lives in `providers/slack/` because the whole lifecycle is Slack-shaped
 * (the manifest, the OAuth exchange, the app-manager scopes); only the
 * MODELS are neutral (ChannelInstallation). A provider that grows its own
 * shared-app concept implements its own lifecycle behind the `sharedApp`
 * facet on `ChannelProvider` — the generic layer reaches this module only
 * through that facet and the provider-scoped routes.
 *
 * TRUST: the install callback carries no session. The signed state names the
 * org and the admin who started the install; the code exchange itself can
 * only be completed by the deployment's client secret. A workspace that
 * gates installs behind admin approval simply completes later — the state
 * TTL is generous (the link can sit in an approval queue), and a fresh
 * install link is one click away.
