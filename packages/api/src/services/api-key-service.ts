 * rate at one row per key per window no matter how hot the key is.
 *

/**
 * Record that `apiKey` just authenticated — throttled, and deliberately NOT a
 * write on the per-request path.
 *
 * Two guards, in order:
 *
 * 1. The stored `lastUsedAt` comes back on the row the auth lookup already
 *    read, so the freshness check costs zero extra I/O. Inside the throttle
 *    window this returns immediately having touched nothing — which is the
 *    overwhelming majority of authenticated requests.
 * 2. When the window HAS elapsed, the update repeats the staleness test in its
 *    own `where`. That makes the write idempotent across concurrent requests
 *    and across replicas: a burst that all read the same stale row issues N
 *    statements but only the first matches a row, the rest are no-ops.
 *
 * The `where` also pins the key VALUE, not just the row id. Without it,
 * rotation races the write: `regenerateApiKey` swaps in a new secret and
 * clears `lastUsedAt` on the SAME row, so a request that authenticated with
 * the OLD secret milliseconds earlier could land afterwards, match the
 * `lastUsedAt: null` arm precisely *because* rotation just cleared it, and
 * stamp the new secret as used — showing "Last used just now" on a key nobody
 * has ever held, at the exact moment an operator rotates a leak and checks.
 *
 * Never throws and never reports failure upward — usage telemetry must not be
 * able to turn a request that authenticates today into one that 401s tomorrow.
 * Returns whether a write was attempted (the throttle's observable behaviour).
 *
 * Note it goes through Prisma, so a write also advances the row's `@updatedAt`.
 * Nothing reads `api_keys.updated_at` today; if anything ever wants to mean
 * "when this secret was last rotated", it needs its own column rather than
 * that one.
