# TODO(fork-domain): every onecli.sh / app.onecli.sh / *@onecli.sh string in
# this script still points at upstream's install domain and support email —
# left as-is pending a fork domain decision (see decision 0.C in
# docs/upstream-sync/v2-migration/phase0-plan.md).
#
# Usage: curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# The URL people open OneCLI at (the ONE networking var most installs set —
# every other address derives from it; http means ports, https means a proxy):
#   export ONECLI_EXTERNAL_URL=http://192.168.1.50:10254
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# Custom bind host (which interface the ports publish on; listen-only):
#   export ONECLI_BIND_HOST=192.168.1.50
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# Custom PostgreSQL port (if 5432 is already in use):
#   export POSTGRES_PORT=5433
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# Custom app/gateway/api ports (e.g. for multi-user hosts):
#   export ONECLI_APP_PORT=11254
#   export ONECLI_GATEWAY_PORT=11255
#   export ONECLI_API_PORT=11256
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# Pin a specific version:
#   export ONECLI_VERSION=1.2.0
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# Hosted agents run by default (the runner service). Install without them:
#   export COMPOSE_PROFILES=
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
# (or edit the COMPOSE_PROFILES line in ~/.onecli/.env later — empty disables.)
#
# Re-running this script IS the update path: it refreshes every image — the
# agent sandbox image included, which `docker compose pull` cannot reach — and
# then restarts this installation's agent sandboxes so they come back on the
# new image. Keep them running instead (they stay on the old agent image until
# they next restart on their own):
#   export ONECLI_KEEP_SANDBOXES=1
#   curl -fsSL https://onecli.sh/install | sh
#
# This script checks for Docker, downloads the docker-compose.yml matching the
# requested version, and starts OneCLI (dashboard + API + gateway + PostgreSQL
# + the hosted-agents runner) on ports 10254/10255/10256 by default.
