# OneCLI agent sandbox — the hosted agent's computer (hosted-agents v2, step 2)
# Build context: repo root (run with `docker build -f docker/agent.Dockerfile .`)
#
# Three deliberate divergences from the sibling images, all load-bearing:
# - Base is trixie-slim, NOT alpine: the jcode runtime is a glibc binary —
#   musl can't run it, and it requires glibc >= 2.39 (bookworm's 2.36 is too
#   old) plus a dynamic libssl. The build PROVES the fit below.
# - The jcode RUNTIME is vendored from the pinned GitHub release and
#   checksum-verified, NOT taken from npm: the npm platform packages lag
#   upstream (they still ship the broken v0.67.1), and the runtime
#   self-updates by default — checking on every process start and exec()ing
#   itself mid-run when a newer release exists, which killed every fresh
#   agent's first turn. The pin is three parts: this vendored binary
#   (ONECLI_JCODE_BINARY), JCODE_NO_AUTO_UPDATE baked below, and the
#   supervisor deleting the updater's builds/ dirs from persistent volumes
#   at boot (harness/jcode.ts). @1jehuang/jcode-sdk stays as the CLIENT
#   library only (its wire protocol major is 1 across 0.67.x–0.81.x);
#   its bundled npm binary is deleted from the final image so a
#   misconfiguration fails loudly instead of silently running 0.67.1.
# - pnpm install must NEVER use --omit=optional: other packages' optional
#   deps must still resolve normally (the jcode binaries are pruned
#   explicitly, afterwards, by path).

# tini as PID 1: Node is not an init (signal handling differs, orphans are
# never reaped). Common tools are the agent's hands — every outbound request
# they make still exits through the gateway (§3.4).
# e2fsprogs + util-linux serve the Kubernetes/Kata boot phase (the sandbox
# manager's boot.sh formats and mounts the raw block home, then setpriv-drops
# to `node` — plans/sandbox-platform.md step 2); inert under the Docker
# backend, where the home arrives as a pre-mounted volume.
# openssh-sftp-server + openssh-client serve the SSH front door (step 5):
# the terminator's relay execs /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server for sftp and
# modern scp (≥9.0 rides sftp), and openssh-client provides the in-guest scp
# binary legacy `scp -O` targets — no daemon, no listener, the no-inbound
# posture is untouched (and agents get a useful ssh client of their own).
# podman + friends give the agent `docker run`-class work as ROOTLESS
# containers (the `docker` CLI itself arrives via podman-docker). Explicitly
# listed because they are only Recommends of podman: uidmap (setuid
# newuidmap/newgidmap — the user-namespace helpers), passt (pasta, the
# default rootless network) + slirp4netns (fallback), fuse-overlayfs
# (storage fallback; native overlay is the expected driver), aardvark-dns +
# iptables (netavark named networks / compose), catatonit (pod infra /
# --init). This is a capability of the hosted microVM substrate, where each
# sandbox owns a whole kernel; under the self-host Docker backend the same
# binaries are deliberately inert — the runner pins `no-new-privileges` +
# `CapDrop: ALL` on every sandbox (apps/runner/src/backend/docker/
# docker-backend.ts, pinned by its test), which neuters the setuid helpers.
# Never weaken those guards to chase this feature on a shared kernel; see
# /etc/containers/README.onecli (baked below) for the agent-visible note.
# python3 + python3-pip + python3-venv: the agent's second toolchain (node is
# the runtime; python is the lingua franca of one-off scripting). Debian
# marks the interpreter externally-managed (PEP 668), so pip refuses every
# install out of the box — PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES (env, below) opens it,
# and as uid 1000 the system site-packages is unwritable anyway, so installs
# land in the user scheme under the DURABLE home (~/.local — bin dir shared
# with npm's global prefix). python3-venv also ships the offline pip wheel
# the durable-home gate below installs from.
# nano + less: the SSH front door needs an editor and a pager (neither ships
# in slim, and --no-install-recommends keeps git from pulling less in);
# EDITOR/PAGER/LESS pin them below.
# The browser stack — chromium + chromium-sandbox + dbus-x11 + xvfb + fonts +
# ffmpeg: agents need browsers (decided 2026-09-09, plans/agent-owns-its-
# machine.md Tier 1). Playwright/Puppeteer from npm or pip drive the baked
# binary at /usr/bin/chromium; the alternative — the harness's own
# Firefox-extension browser tool — can never work in a headless guest and is
# disabled in the adapter. Four load-bearing details:
# - dbus-x11 is listed BEFORE chromium on purpose: chromium's dbus dependency
#   is satisfied by either dbus-x11 or dbus-user-session, and apt's default
#   pick (dbus-user-session) drags in systemd + systemd-sysv + libpam-systemd
#   — an init system this tini-PID-1 image must never carry. Naming dbus-x11
#   first makes the resolver take it instead (measured: 162 packages, no
#   systemd, vs 168 with). The gate below pins systemd's ABSENCE.
# - chromium-sandbox is the setuid helper (400 KB) that lets chromium's
#   DEFAULT sandbox run as uid 1000 where user namespaces are available —
#   the hosted microVM. Under the self-host Docker backend the same
#   `no-new-privileges` + `CapDrop: ALL` that neuter podman's setuid helpers
#   neuter this one too, and chromium must be told `--no-sandbox` (Playwright:
#   `chromiumSandbox: false`). Same law as podman: never weaken the Docker
#   guards for it; /etc/onecli/README.browser (baked below) tells the agent.
# - xvfb is the fallback display for the rare tool that refuses headless
#   mode; fonts-liberation + fonts-noto-color-emoji stop pages rendering as
#   empty boxes (slim ships no fonts at all).
# - ffmpeg is the video half: Playwright records .webm natively, and frames
#   or screenshots are stitched with ffmpeg. The gate proves VP9 encoding.
# - libnss3-tools is `certutil`, the only way to add a CA to the NSS shared
#   DB — and that DB is the ONLY trust store chromium reads on Linux
#   (chromium docs, linux/cert_management.md): it ignores SSL_CERT_FILE and
#   NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS. Every page here is re-signed by the gateway CA, so
#   without the import agent-entrypoint.sh does with this tool, every load
#   fails ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID and the agent's escape by trial is
#   ignoreHTTPSErrors — verification off for every site (measured live on
#   prod, 2026-09-09). The gate below proves the import is what chromium
#   trusts, on a real handshake.
# gcc + g++ + make + libc6-dev + python3-dev: the C toolchain for native npm
# and pip modules (better-sqlite3, sharp, bcrypt, psycopg2, lxml…) that ship
# no prebuilt binary for this platform/runtime pairing and fall back to
# compiling at install time — without a compiler the install fails with a
# wall of gyp/gcc errors and the agent concludes the package is broken.
# Deliberately NOT build-essential: same compilers, minus 57 MB of dpkg-dev
# nothing here uses.
# procps + jq + zip + unzip + wget: the baseline any Linux box has and slim
# does not (`ps` in particular — an agent that cannot list its own processes
# burns turns on it).
# xz-utils: `.tar.xz` is the release format of half the tools an agent will
# fetch (Nix itself ships that way); slim has no xz.

# Rootless-podman wiring. Four pieces, each load-bearing:
# - /etc/subuid + /etc/subgid: OVERWRITTEN, not appended — the base image
#   already allocates node:100000:65536, and a duplicate row makes newuidmap
#   fail with EINVAL (rootless dead). The range is a DURABLE-DATA FORMAT
#   CONTRACT: it is baked into the ownership of every file podman writes on
#   the persistent home volume, so changing it in a later image strands every
#   existing agent's container storage. Never "tidy" it; the gate below pins
#   the exact value.
# - containers.conf (root-owned): the no-systemd in-sandbox posture —
#   cgroupfs manager with cgroups disabled (limits come from the sandbox
#   itself; there is no journald for events/logs either), and
#   image_copy_tmp_dir="storage" so pull staging lands on the agent's own
#   home volume instead of /var/tmp on the ephemeral rootfs (which sits on
#   shared node storage under Kata). base_hosts_file="" pins "copy the
#   sandbox's /etc/hosts into containers" — the only way a nested container
#   can resolve the gateway proxy host (sandboxes have no DNS egress).
# - registries.conf (root-owned): docker.io for unqualified names, so
#   `podman pull postgres` resolves.
# - storage.conf (node-owned, USER-level — rootless podman ignores the
#   graphroot in /etc/containers/storage.conf): graphroot on /workspace, the
#   durable home, so images/containers/volumes survive relaunch and
#   park/wake. The file stays at its /home/node path ON PURPOSE, even now
#   that ~ lives at /workspace/.home: this copy is image-baked and
#   self-heals every boot (an agent-editable durable copy would not), and
#   the storage path inside it is a DURABLE-DATA FORMAT CONTRACT — moving
#   either strands every existing agent's container store.
#   CONTAINERS_STORAGE_CONF (env, below) pins the same file regardless of

# The durable POSIX home: ~ = /workspace/.home, ON the home volume. Three
# pieces:
# - usermod: passwd is where the Docker substrate derives HOME from (runc
#   fills HOME from the passwd entry when the env lacks it — spawn AND
#   exec); the hosted boot script and agent-entrypoint.sh export the same
#   literal (byte-equal contract with apps/sandbox-manager/src/constants.ts
#   AGENT_POSIX_HOME).
# - the profile.d drop-in: SSH login shells — Debian's /etc/profile RESETS
#   PATH, so the entrypoint's export cannot survive `bash -l`/`sh -lc`.
#   APPENDED, never prepended: a tenant-writable dir ahead of the system
#   dirs would let a planted binary shadow git/node/curl for every session.
#   POSIX-only syntax — `sh -lc` sessions run dash, which sources
#   /etc/profile.d too.
# - the directory itself is created at CONTAINER runtime by
#   agent-entrypoint.sh as uid 1000 — deliberately NOT here: root must never
#   create tenant-mount dirs, and content baked under /workspace forks the
#   substrates (Docker seeds named volumes from image content; the hosted
