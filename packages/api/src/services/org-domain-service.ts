/**
 * The organization's claimed email domains: list / claim / verify / delete.
 *
 * ## The state model is the schema's, not ours
 *
 * `OrganizationDomain.verifiedAt` is the WHOLE state machine: null means
 * claimed-but-pending, non-null means verified. Every trust decision reads
 * `verifiedAt`, never mere row existence — a row is only ever an assertion by
 * whoever typed it until DNS backs it up.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `failed` state. "Failed" is the outcome of a CHECK,
 * not a property of the domain: DNS may propagate thirty seconds after a miss,
 * so a persisted failure would be stale the moment it was written and would
 * make the row lie about the world. A miss therefore leaves the row completely
 * untouched and throws; the client holds that outcome in component state until
 * the next check.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Every read and write is scoped to ONE organization — the caller's
 * `auth.organizationId`, never a body parameter — with the `findFirst({ id,
 * organizationId })` / `deleteMany({ id, organizationId })` idiom the rest of
 * the org surface uses, so a cross-org id reads as absent (404) rather than
 * leaking or mutating another tenant's row.
