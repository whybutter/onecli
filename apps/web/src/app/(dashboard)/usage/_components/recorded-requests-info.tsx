/**
 * The disclosure that keeps the Requests card honest.
 *
 * `request_logs` is not a record of all gateway traffic: the gateway writes a
 * row only when it injected a credential or made a non-plain-allow policy
 * decision (`apps/gateway/src/telemetry.rs`). A pass-through on an agent's own
 * key is never recorded, so the number below the title is a floor, not a total.
 * The card says "recorded gateway requests" and this explains the gap — it is
 * not optional polish, it is what stops the card from overstating what it knows.
 *
 * A `Popover`, deliberately NOT a `Tooltip`: Radix tooltips open on hover and
 * keyboard focus but not on tap, which would leave the caveat unreadable on a
 * phone. A disclosure this load-bearing has to be reachable on every input —
 * click/tap and keyboard alike.
