//! `(host, path, method)` fan-out and matches it through the gateway's own
//! `host_matches` + `matches_request` — so an app-target rule enforces identically
//! to the network rows it was compiled from (§7.7).
//!
//! Single source of truth: the JSON is DERIVED from and drift-checked against the
//! TypeScript catalog (`packages/api/src/apps/app-permissions/catalog-json.ts`),
//! so the TS translator and this Rust expansion can never disagree. The two files
//! is read at compile time (like `corpus_test`'s corpus) and covers the shared
