 * Body of `POST /v1/gateway/client-cert`. `.strict()` deliberately — this
 * schema is also the enforcement point for "no key material in the
 * request": any extra field (a `keyPem`, `privateKey`, ...) fails validation
 * outright rather than being silently stripped, so a client that
 * misunderstands the flow (and tries to hand over a key instead of proving
 * possession via CSR) gets a clear 400, not a request that quietly ignores
 * what it sent.
 *
 * `hostId` is optional: omitted on first enrollment (the route mints a new
 * `ClientHost`), provided on renewal (the route reuses that host's existing
 * identity — see `ensureClientHost`, which is also where the workspace-scoped
 * lookup enforcing this lives; this schema only checks the shape).
