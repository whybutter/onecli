/**
 * Where the connections tab bar points, and which tab the current URL is on.
 *
 * Extracted from `connections-tabs.tsx` so it can be unit tested without a DOM.
 * There are now TWO sections ending in `connections` — the project page at
 * `/connections` and the org page at `/global-connections` — and the fallback
 * path parsing used to be a substring scan for the literal `"/connections"`.
 * That scan does NOT match `/global-connections` (the `connections` there is
 * preceded by `-`, not `/`), so it fell through to its `/connections` default:
 * every org tab pointed at the PROJECT page, and every org URL read as the
 * `apps` tab. No error, no warning — the tabs simply went somewhere else.
 *
 * Matching whole SEGMENTS is what makes the two sections distinguishable.
 * `basePath` still wins when a caller passes it; the fallback is now correct on
 * its own rather than relying on every caller remembering to.
