//! Cert-identity ↔ agent-token tenant binding — the payoff of the mTLS +
//! relay stack: a relay's client-certificate identity may only carry agent
//! tokens for its own tenant.
//!
//! Everything here is pure and DB-free: [`evaluate`] takes an
//! already-resolved [`db::ClientHostRow`] lookup result and returns a
//! [`BindingDecision`]. The I/O (the cached DB lookup, and turning a `Deny`
//! into an actual HTTP response) lives in `server`'s `binding_enforce`
//! module, whose `enforce_binding` is the ONLY caller of [`evaluate`] — so
//! the CONNECT and HTTP-proxy entry points can never drift from each other
//! or from this decision table.
//!
//! # The binding rule
//!
//! A request is permitted iff the `ClientHost` resolved from the cert
//! identity's spiffe URI has `workspace_id == token.workspace_id`, is not
//! revoked, and — when it also carries an `organization_id` — that value
//! equals the token's `organization_id` too (a redundant consistency check;
//! workspace scoping alone is already sufficient, since a workspace belongs
//! to exactly one org). The `ClientHost` row IS the allowlist entry: no row
//! for this spiffe URI means no permission, full stop (deny-unless-permitted,
//! never a blocklist).
//!
//! # Modes
//!
//! `GATEWAY_BINDING_ENFORCEMENT` ([`BindingMode::from_env`]) defaults to
//! [`BindingMode::Off`] — unset, this module is a complete no-op and the
//! gateway behaves exactly as if binding enforcement did not exist. `Log`
//! computes the same decision as `Enforce` but never denies — a would-be
//! deny becomes [`BindingDecision::WouldDeny`], which the caller logs and
//! then allows anyway, so an operator can watch what enforcement WOULD do
//! before flipping the switch. `Enforce` denies for real.
//!
//! # The two subtleties this module (and its caller) must get right
//!
//! 1. Exemption is by LISTENER KIND (`on_mtls`), never by
//!    `identity.is_some()`. An mTLS handshake whose cert has an unparseable
//!    CN/SAN also yields no identity — and that case must be DENIED in
//!    enforce (nothing in the cert can satisfy the allowlist), not waved
//!    through as if it came in on the plain listener.
//! 2. The plain listener (web-app / loopback / all-in-one local-agent path,
//!    no cert involved at all) is exempt in EVERY mode — enforcing there
//!    would deny all of that traffic, which never had a certificate to bind
//!    in the first place.
