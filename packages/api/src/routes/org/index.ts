/**
 * The OSS edition's EDITION SURFACE: `/v1/org/*` PLUS `/v1/projects/*`.
 *
 * OSS-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. This is never registered in the shared
 * `createApiApp` route table: it is mounted through
 * `CreateApiAppOptions.eeRoutes` from the OSS init seam
 * (`apps/web/src/lib/init/api.ts`), which every EE edition aliases away and
 * replaces with its own org router. Registering here rather than in `app.ts`
 * keeps the shared file free of edition-specific routes (upstream-merge
 * collisions) and avoids Hono's first-registration-wins silently shadowing an
 * EE route with an OSS one — which is exactly why project administration is
 * registered here too, even though its URL is not under `/org`. The exported
 * name stays `registerOssOrgRoutes`: renaming it buys nothing and touches the
 * init seam plus every route test.
 *
 * Mounting a sub-app re-registers its `use("*")` guards under the mount path,
 * so each sub-app's guard stack covers every path beneath it — and only those.
 * `/projects` therefore owns the whole `/v1/projects/*` namespace in OSS; do
 * not register a second router there.
 *
 * Later org slices (role mappings, …) append their `app.route(...)` line here.
